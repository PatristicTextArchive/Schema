# Schema
TEI-derived schema against which PTA XML should be validated.

The master file is tei-pta.odd.

Derived from this file is tei-pta.rng and pta-catalog.xml (and the linked files tei_pta.xsd, tei_pta_xml.xsd, tei_pta_dcr.xsd and tei_pta_ns1.xsd).

The schema is a living document and open for changes: notifications of errors, ideas for additions or adaptions for other edition scenaria are welcome.
