# Schema

TEI-derived schema against which PTA XML should be validated.

The master file is `tei-pta.odd`.

Derived from this file is `tei-pta.rng` and `tei-pta.sch`.

For linguistically annotated PTA XML files, the schema to be used is (the non-TEI-conformant) `tei-pta_linguistic.odd` (and the derived `tei-pta_linguistic.rng`).

The schema is a living document and open for changes: notifications of errors, ideas for additions or adaptions for other edition scenaria are welcome.

Documentation is to be found in the folder “documentation” (currently German and English).

The folder “scripts” contains a xslt (together with a bash script) for updating files to v.3.0 of the schema.
